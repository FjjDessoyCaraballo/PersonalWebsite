		project: "Webcrawler", 
        description1: "Written in python, the crawler bot retrieves companies' logos. It operates in a similar fashion as GPT, Google, and other crawler bots that indexate websites. This was done with minimal external libraries and depends mostly on built-in libraries.",
        description2: "This web crawler systematically extracts logos from websites using async HTTP requests and SQLite storage. The system includes intelligent scoring algorithms to evaluate logo detection confidence and respects robots.txt protocols. I implemented both crawler and fetcher components that work together to discover and download company logos from domain lists.",
		description3: "Libraries/frameworks/technologies used: nix virtual-environment, SQLite3, aiohttp, asyncio, poetry",
		gifPath: webcrawler,
		link: "https://www.github.com/fjjdessoycaraballo/webcrawler"
	},
	ft_transcendence: {
		project: "ft_transcendence",
		description1: "My team developed a full-stack multiplayer gaming platform featuring Pong and Block Battle games with real-time gameplay powered by Socket.IO. The backend uses Node.js with Fastify, JWT authentication, and SQLite storage, while the frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and HTML5 Canvas for game rendering. I implemented user authentication, UI/UX, and GDPR compliance features, all containerized with Docker.",
		description2: "My role was on UI/UX, connecting data pipelines, and GDPR compliance. The frontend was done in React. I established the datapilines through a background JS web worker, making XSS attack proof. Additionally, I designed the layout, UI/UX, and general user management aspects of the frontend. As for GDPR compliance, users can request data download, deletion, and anonymization.",

	},
	airguardian: {
		project: "Air-guardian",
		description1: "The Air-guardian is a middleware done in collaboration with Zakaria Farah. This app collects data of drones in JSON format from https://drones-api.hive.fi and analyzes proximity of all drones from the epicenter of our No-Fly Zone (NFZ).",
		description2: "As the Air-guardian tracks and detects offending drones in the NFZ, we log their information into a lightweight database. For recurring offenses, we log the latest offense into the database. This app utilizes Celery for recurring tasks and RabbitMQ for queueing and scheduling tasks.",
		description3: "Libraries/frameworks/technologies used: RabbitMQ, FastAPI, logger, requests, SQLite3, Celery",
		gifPath: airguardian,
		link: "https://www.github.com/fjjdessoycaraballo/air-guardian"
	},
	minishell: {
		project: "Minishell", 
		description1: "Leo Storey and I recreated core bash shell functionality in C, implementing pipes, redirections, built-in commands (echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit), and proper signal handling for CTRL+C, CTRL+, and CTRL+D. I collaborated with a partner using structured Git workflows and achieved 100% completion on this systems programming project.",
        description2: "If you take a look at the technologies used, you will see that there are no major libraries of fancy frameworks being used here. The majority of functionalities were recreated from scratch. There were no memory-safety, no null-safety, nothing. Everything had to be written and checked manually. Notwithstanding, most of the other library tools used here were also written by us.",
		description3: "Libraries/frameworks/technologies used: readline, Makefile, signals.",

	},
	ft_irc: {
		project: "ft_irc",
		description1: "My team created an IRC server in C++ that's IRC client compliant, implementing network programming with TCP sockets. The server accepts port and password parameters and includes planned features for port validation, password policies, and encryption considerations. The project demonstrates low-level network programming and protocol implementation skills.",
		description2: "In less fancy words, this is how people chatted in the web in the old days.",

	ezra: {
		project: "Ezra",
		description1: "I created a Python GUI application using Tkinter for preserving educational content from the defunct BRL Center website through the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The tool systematically scrapes and downloads ZIP files while implementing respectful rate limiting and progress tracking with SQLite caching.",
		description2: "This particular project is not a great show of skill, but it shows my motivation and passion in coding: helping people with my skills.",
