	webcrawler: {
		project: "Webcrawler", 
        description1: "Written in python, the crawler bot retrieves companies logos in CSV format. It operates in a similar fashion as GPT, Google, and other crawler bots that indexate websites. This was done with minimal external libraries and depends mostly on built-in libraries.",
        description2: "This web crawler systematically extracts logos from websites using async HTTP requests and SQLite storage. The system includes intelligent scoring algorithms to evaluate logo detection confidence and respects robots.txt protocols. I implemented both crawler and fetcher components that work together to discover and download company logos from domain lists.",
		description3: "Libraries/frameworks/technologies used: nix virtual-environment, SQLite3, aiohttp, asyncio",
		gifPath: webcrawler,
		link: "https://www.github.com/fjjdessoycaraballo/webcrawler"
	},
	ft_transcendence: {
		project: "ft_transcendence",
		description1: "My team developed a full-stack multiplayer gaming platform featuring Pong and Block Battle games with real-time gameplay powered by Socket.IO. The backend uses Node.js with Fastify, JWT authentication, and SQLite storage, while the frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and HTML5 Canvas for game rendering. I implemented user authentication, UI/UX, and GDPR compliance features, all containerized with Docker.",
		description3: "Libraries/frameworks/technologies used: React, JWT, Node.js, SQLite3, Tailwind CSS, HTML5, WebSockets, Docker, Docker compose, Makefile, REST API, webpack, i18n, fastify.",
        gifPath: transcendence,
		link: "https://www.github.com/fjjdessoycaraballo/ft_transcendence"
	},
	minishell: {
		project: "Minishell", 
		description1: "Me and Leo Storey recreated core bash shell functionality in C, implementing pipes, redirections, built-in commands (echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit), and proper signal handling for CTRL+C, CTRL+, and CTRL+D. I collaborated with a partner using structured Git workflows and achieved 100% completion on this systems programming project.",
        description2: "If you take a look at the technologies used, you will see that there are no major libraries of fancy frameworks being used here. We recreated majority of functionalities from scratch. There were no memory-safety, no null-safety, nothing. Everything had to be written and checked manually. Notwithstanding, most of the other library tools used here were also written by us.",
		description3: "Libraries/frameworks/technologies used: readline, Makefile, signals.",
        gifPath: minishell,
		link: "https://www.github.com/fjjdessoycaraballo/minishell"
	},
	ft_irc: {
		project: "ft_irc",
		description1: "My team created an IRC server in C++ that's IRC client compliant, implementing network programming with TCP sockets. The server accepts port and password parameters and includes planned features for port validation, password policies, and encryption considerations. The project demonstrates low-level network programming and protocol implementation skills.",
		description2: "In less fancy words, this is how people chatted in the web in the old days.",
        description3: "Libraries/frameworks/technologies used: Internet Protocol (IP), webservers, sockets, signals, IRC Protocols and syntax",

	},
	cub3d: {
		project: "cub3d",
		description1: "A replication of Wolfenstein made in C. Here I did the parsing of the map, and Alexandra did the raycasting. This is another project in which we were highly constrained and could not use external libraries, except for the school own graphics library.",
        description2: "As I mentioned, in this specific project I did the parsing, so I was responsible for cleaning and organizing the input in a way that our program would be able to process. It seems rather easy, except that the input file could've been tampered in almost any possible way, except for a few arbitrary exceptions.",
		description3: "Libraries/frameworks/technologies used: graphics (MLX42) and ray-casting",

		link: "https://www.github.com/fjjdessoycaraballo/cub3d"
	},
	ezra: {
		project: "Ezra",
		description1: "I created a Python GUI application using Tkinter for preserving educational content from the defunct BRL Center website through the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The tool systematically scrapes and downloads ZIP files while implementing respectful rate limiting and progress tracking with SQLite caching.",
		description2: "This particular project is not a great show of skill, but it shows my motivation and passion in coding: helping people with my skills.",
        description3: "Libraries/frameworks/technologies used: tkinter, HTTP requests, SQLite3, HTMLParser, HTML5",
