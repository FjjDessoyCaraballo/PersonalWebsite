						My name is Felipe Justo Jos√© Dessoy Caraballo. I'm a Brazilian that speaks fluently 
						Portuguese, English, Spanish, and has a good grasp of Finnish. Aside from that, I'm
						a software engineer and political scientist (wow, right).<br/><br/>
						
						As a full stack engineer I am currently looking for my first role in the IT 
						industry. During 2023 and 2025 I studied in Hive Helsinki coding in C/C++ mostly.
						Before that I was a political scientist focused on quantitative methods using R 
						and Python.<br/><br/>
						
						After years of working with low and high-level languages, and increasing my stack,
						I've developed some projects that I am very proud of.<br/>
